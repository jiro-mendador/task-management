NOTE WHEN SENDING DEADLINE NOTIF FOR THE USER : 
1. Gather projects info expiring in the current day.
2. Then send the all-in-one deadline notif for all projects.
3. If sending an email succeeds add the user data in json to flag as isEmailSent : true
4. Then a loop to check for some failed emails then send again.

NOTE : 
  Worker script for email sending is triggered using the dashboard page (user interaction dependent). 
  Depending on the webhost it should be triggered once per day 
    as script outside the site to be independent from user accessing the page

NOTE : 
- For scenarios when a user edited a project's deadline 
  or add another project with the deadline set to 
  current day but the web app already sent an email for that day 
  then the web app will just ignore it
